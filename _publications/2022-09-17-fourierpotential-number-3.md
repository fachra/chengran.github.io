This paper provides a new representation of the diffusion MRI signal by solving the Bloch-Torrey PDE using potential theory. The decomposition of the single layer potential into singular and smooth parts allows the numerically efficient storage of the smooth part on a Fourier basis. Time integrals in the form of certain exponentials enable us to use time recursion to avoid history-dependence. We numerically validated the convergence of our method and showed the error behavior in several simulation parameters.
