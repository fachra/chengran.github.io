This paper provides to the public the constructed finite element meshes for a group of 36 pyramidal neurons and a group of 29 spindle neurons whose morphological descriptions were found in the neuron repository NeuroMorpho.Org.

To illustrate some potential uses of the Neuron Module, we show numerical examples of the simulated diffusion MRI signals in multiple diffusion directions from whole neurons as well as from the soma and dendrite branches, and include a comparison of the high b-value behavior between dendrite branches and whole neurons. Furthermore, we perform a statistical study on the set of 65 neurons to test some candidate biomarkers that can potentially indicate the soma size.
